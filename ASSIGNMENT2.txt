- Horsepower: The mean (105.08) is higher than the median (95), which means most cars have lower horsepower, but a few powerful cars increase the average. The high standard deviation (38.77) shows that there's a lot of variation in horsepower among the cars.

- Weight: The mean (2979.41) is higher than the median (2822.5), suggesting that some heavy cars are pushing the average weight up. The large standard deviation (847.00) means there is a wide range of car weights, with both light and heavy cars in the data.

Interpretation:
Mean: Reflects the average value. 
a higher mean indicates powerful engines (horsepower) or heavy cars (weight).
Median: The middle value.
 a difference between mean and median suggests skewed data.
Standard Deviation: Measures variability. 
a high value indicates a wide range of horsepower or weight values.
